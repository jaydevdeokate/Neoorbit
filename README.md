# 🌀 NEOORBIT

A minimal arcade-style survival game made for the browser.  
Built and tested entirely on a phone.

**One rule:** don’t crash.  
**One button:** flip direction.  
**One screen:** pure focus.

## 🎮 Gameplay

You orbit around the center while hostile objects rush inward.  
Survive as long as you can while speed and pressure increase.

### Controls
- **FLIP** — reverse orbit direction
- **⏸ Pause** — pause the game
- **🔊 Mute** — toggle sound

Designed for **touch-first play**.

## 🌓 Game Modes

### Echo Mode
Balanced and calm.
- Smooth difficulty ramp
- Forgiving pace
- Designed for longer runs

### Void Mode
Legacy chaos.
- Faster escalation
- Less mercy
- Inspired by an earlier unbounded version of the game

Void is intentional. Echo is refined.
